## üìä Progress Tracking

| Category | Completed | Remaining | Progress |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Services | 3 | 4 | 43% |
| Infrastructure | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Testing | Unit tests | Integration + Load | 40% |
| Deployment | CI/CD | Terraform + K8s | 30% |

**Overall Project Progress:** ~55%

## üöÄ How to Proceed

### Option 1: Continue Phase 5
Focus on completing Plan Service with tests.

### Option 2: Build User Service
Parallel work while Plan Service is being finished.

### Option 3: Start Video Services
Begin Video Service implementation.

### Option 4: Infrastructure First
Complete Terraform and Kubernetes setup before finishing services.

---

**Recommendation:** Complete Phase 5 (Plan Service) first, as it's critical for P1 (Core Flow) and follows the CoT strategy in the development plan.
