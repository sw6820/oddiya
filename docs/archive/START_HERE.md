# 🚀 START HERE - Oddiya Project

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Phase 0: Complete Setup ✅
- Git repository initialized and organized
- Comprehensive development plan with Chain of Thought ultrathink
- Task Master AI integration configured
- Directory structure created
- All commits by feature for easy rollback

### Current Git Status

```bash
7 commits on main branch
```

```
7c7d80f chore: add Task Master AI project initialization files
d958e5e chore: update .gitignore and add Task Master AI integration docs
5809e87 docs: add project README with status and quick start
1d9cde4 docs: add development plan with CoT ultrathink strategy
a772754的眼神: add .gitignore for Java, Python, Docker, Kubernetes
b665109 docs: initial project documentation (TechSpecPRD.md, CLAUDE.md)
```

## 🎯 What's Next

### Option 1: Start Phase 1 (Local Infrastructure) ⬇️
**Goal:** Set up Docker Compose with PostgreSQL and Redis

Create:
- `docker-compose.yml`
- Database schema migrations
- Local environment configuration
- Test local connectivity

**Command to start:** "Start Phase 1" or "Begin Phase 1"

---

### Option 2: Use Task Master AI to Parse PRD 📋
**Goal:** Automatically generate tasks from TECH SPEC

**Commands:**
```bash
# Parse the TechSpecPRD to generate tasks
task-master parse-prd TechSpecPRD.md

# Analyze complexity
task-master analyze-complexity --research

# Expand tasks into subtasks
task-master expand --all --research

# See next task
task-master next
```

**Note:** You'll need API keys in `.env` (see `.env.example`)

---

### Option 3: Skip to Phase 2 (Auth Service) 🔐
**Goal:** Start building Auth Service directly (assuming local DB is ready)

**Warning:** You'll need to set up local PostgreSQL/Redis first or this won't work!

## 📚 Key Documents

- **[DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)** - Complete CoT plan with ultrathink strategy
- **[GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md)** - Task Master AI integration guide  
- **[TechSpecPRD.md](TechSpecPRD.md)** - Full technical specification
- **[README.md](README.md)** - Project overview
- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Quick reference guide

## 🔄 How to Rollback

Any commit can be rolled back:

```bash
# View commits
git log --oneline

# Rollback to specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or reset to specific point
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## 💡 Recommended Next Step

**I recommend starting with Phase 1 (Local Infrastructure)** because:
1. All other phases depend on having PostgreSQL and Redis running locally
2. Docker Compose setup is quick (30 mins) and low-risk
3. Validates your local development environment
4. Enables testing for all future services

**Ready to begin Phase 1?** Just say "Start Phase 1"!
