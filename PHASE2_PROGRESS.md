# Phase 2 Progress: Auth Service

## âœ… Completed (Committed)

### Structure Setup
- âœ… Spring Boot 3.2 project initialized with build.gradle
- âœ… Application configuration (application.yml) with OAuth2, Redis, JWT settings
- âœ… Package structure created
- âœ… DTOs: TokenResponse, RefreshTokenRequest, OAuthCallbackRequest
- âœ… Basic controller: AuthController with endpoint stubs
- âœ… JWT configuration: JwtConfig with RSA key pair generation

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Work

### Core Authentication Logic
- [ ] JwtService - RS256 token generation and parsing
- [ ] OAuthService - Handle OAuth callback flow
- [ ] UserLookupService - Integration with User Service
- [ ] Redis service for refresh token storage
- [ ] Security configuration

### OAuth Integration
- [ ] Exchange authorization code for Google tokens
- [ ] Fetch user info from Google
- [ ] Create/find user via User Service internal API

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests with Testcontainers

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Implement JwtService with RS256
2. Implement OAuth flow with Google
3. Add Redis storage for refresh tokens
4. Integrate with User Service
5. Add error handling

## Commit Strategy

Will commit by feature:
- `feat(auth): implement JWT service with RS256`
- `feat(auth): add OAuth Google integration`
- `feat(auth): add Redis refresh token storage`
- `feat(auth): integrate with User Service`
- `feat(auth): add comprehensive error handling`
- `test(auth): add unit and integration tests`
