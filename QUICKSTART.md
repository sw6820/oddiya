# Quick Start Guide

## What We've Accomplished (Phase 0 ✅)

1. ✅ Git repository initialized (`main` branch)
2. ✅ Comprehensive `.gitignore` created (Java, Python, Docker, K8s)
3. ✅ Development plan with Chain of Thought ultrathink strategy
4. ✅ Project directory structure created
5. ✅ README documentation added

## Current Commit History

```bash
5809e87 docs: add project README with status and quick start
1d9cde4 docs: add development plan with CoT ultrathink strategy
a772754 chore: add .gitignore for Java, Python, Docker, Kubernetes
b665109 docs: initial project documentation (TechSpecPRD.md, CLAUDE.md)
```

## How to Rollback

If any phase has errors, you can easily rollback:

```bash
# View all commits
git log --oneline

# Rollback to specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or reset to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## Next Steps - Phase 1: Local Infrastructure

**Goal:** Get Docker Compose running with PostgreSQL and Redis

**Tasks:**
1. Create `docker-compose.yml`
2. Set up PostgreSQL 17.0 with schema initialization
3. Set up Redis 7.4
4. Create database migration scripts
5. Test connectivity

**Start Phase 1:** Ready when you are! Type "start Phase 1" or "begin Phase 1"

## Gemini MCP Note

I don't have direct Gemini MCP access in this environment. The tools available are:
- Shrimp Task Manager
- Context7 (library documentation)
- Task Master AI
- Figma MCP
- Playwright Browser MCP

However, I can:
- Generate code and architecture following best practices
- Create detailed technical discussions
- Help you review code and make decisions
- Simulate "debates" by presenting multiple perspectives

Would you like me to present alternative architectural decisions for any part of the system? I can show pros/cons for different approaches.
